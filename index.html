        The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by
        Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the
        longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh
        generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The
        namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed
        as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from
        existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck"
        proportions.
